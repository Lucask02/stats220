*This report analyzes responses from a transport usage form to explore commuting behaviors and preferences across age and time of day.*

## Transporation usage for commuting

![Transportaion Usage](plot1.png)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSm22IrT9r0H6mTjF-PlbhIhQbCKsC6ruOW8G2s_7raorH2YrdRFRr0wyl4YVUyNG67YROGVoDFOV01/pub?output=csv"
logged_data <- read_csv(url)

# Preprocess
logged_data <- logged_data %>%
  mutate(
    Timestamp = dmy_hms(Timestamp),
    Hour = hour(Timestamp),
    Day = wday(Timestamp, label = TRUE),
    TransportType = `What is your type of transportation for commuting`)

# Calculate percentages
transport_summary <- logged_data %>%
  count(`Do you use transportation for commuting?`) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1))

# Extract values
yes_perc <- transport_summary %>%
  filter(`Do you use transportation for commuting?` == "Yes") %>%
  pull(percentage)

no_perc <- transport_summary %>%
  filter(`Do you use transportation for commuting?` == "No commuting") %>%
  pull(percentage)

```

Pie chart above displays that `r {yes_perc}`% of respondents use transportation for commuting, meanwhile `r {no_perc}`% do not commute.

**Insight** - A significant majority (`r {yes_perc}`%) rely on transportation for commuting, suggesting a high dependency on mobility solutions in daily life.


## Types for Transporation usage for commuting


![Transportation Types](plot2.png)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(glue)

# Summarize and calculate percentages
plot2_data <- logged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(`What is your type of transportation for commuting`)) %>%
  count(`What is your type of transportation for commuting`) %>%
  mutate(perc = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1))

# Extract top 2 transport types
top2 <- plot2_data %>%
  arrange(desc(perc)) %>%
  slice(1:2)

# Extract values
type1 <- top2$`What is your type of transportation for commuting`[1]
type2 <- top2$`What is your type of transportation for commuting`[2]
perc1 <- top2$perc[1]
perc2 <- top2$perc[2]


```

Pie chart above shows that Bus and Car (including Uber/taxi) have analogous usage frequency range (`r perc1` ~ `r perc2`%), whereas usage frequency of Motorcycle and Walking are significantly lower.

**Insight** - Most number of commuters are classified analogously between Bus and Car (including Uber or taxi). This implies varied commuting preferences and potential areas for infrastructure development (e.g., improving bus services or regulating ride-share usage).

## The timestamp of responses of my survey


![Responses timestamp](plot3.png)

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

Line graph showing submission frequency by hour, peaking dramatically between 6pm and 8pm.

**Insight** - Submissions spike in the evening, which could inform future survey or outreach timings for higher engagement.

## Transporation usage for commuting by age (6am - 10pm)

![Responses timestamp](plot4.png)

```{r echo=FALSE}

```
Scatter plot showing transport type distribution by age and hour of day, with most responses clustered around 6PM–8PM.

**Insight** - Younger participants (18–25) dominate the response pool. Most responses came in the evening (6PM–8PM), perhaps reflecting survey availability or user behavior patterns.

## Summary of visual data story

- Most of my respondents use transportation to commute, primarily relying on cars and buses.
- Younger people (age between 18-25) dominate the data, with most responses submitted in the evening.
- Pie and scatter plots were used to communicate the relationship between transport type for commuting and age of respondents a fixed range of timestamps.
- Data was organised using `na.rm = TRUE` in order to minimise the outlier and unsuitable values for my purpose and manipulated using `mutate()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` to prepare plots.

This visual story informs policy makers, urban planners, and transportation services to better understand commuter trends and optimize resource planning.
